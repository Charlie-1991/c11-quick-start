      <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
      <p>
        We use HTML tags to define the structure of our webpage. Each different
        tag gives meaning to the content in between the tags, and often changes
        the way it appears in the web browser, for example this content is
        inside a p tag (paragraph)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>And this, for example, is inside an li (a list item) tag</li>
        <li>
          And here is more content inside another list item inside the same
          "ul", unordered list
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most tags have a specific purpose, for example a "label" tag is meant to
        label user inputs. We'll use a label tag below to label a basic input
        field
      </p>
      <p>And the content below that we'll put inside a button tag</p>
      <label>Type your name here: </label>
      <input />
      <button>Click me!</button>

      <h2>More tags!</h2>
      <p>
        There are hundreds more HTML tags to define the structure of our pages.

      <p>
        You can find a selection of the many of the commonly used ones here (the
        following is an "a" tag, which stands for "anchor", and is used to
        create links):
