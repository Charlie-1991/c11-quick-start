    <h1>Cycling</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Cycling</strong> became popularlised in Europe and North America
      in the latter part and especially the last decade of the 19th century.
      Today, over 50 percent of the human population knows how to ride a
      bike.

        has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting
        soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of
        the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second Boer War, both sides
        used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and
        New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China,
        Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were
        instrumental in Japan's march or "roll" through Malaya in World War II.
        Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed
        airborne "Cycle-commandos" with folding bikes. In the Vietnam War,
        communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the Ho
        Chi Minh Trail. The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle
        troops was Switzerland, which disbanded its last unit in 2003.</p>

        Main article: Bicycle Road cyclists often wear
        tight-fitting clothing to improve performance and comfort for
        competitions. Here, a cyclist wears a summer team cycling kit made with
        Lycra material and a helmet.Video of a recreational cycling ride in

        transport is a utility bicycle. These have frames with relaxed geometry,
        protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low
        speeds. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as
        mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extends their usefulness on a
        daily basis. Since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling">bicycle</a> is so effective as a means of
        transportation, various companies have developed methods of carrying
        anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries
        rely heavily on bicycles and their culture has developed around the
        bicycle as a primary form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the
        Netherlands have the most bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles
        for everyday transport.[6][7] Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape
        and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to
        ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires
        the rider to bend forward more, making use of stronger muscles
        (particularly the gluteus maximus) and reducing air resistance at high
        speed. Road bikes are designed for speed and efficiency on paved roads.
        They are characterized by their lightweight frames, skinny tires, drop
        handlebars, and narrow saddles. Road bikes are ideal for racing,
        long-distance riding, and fitness training. The price of a new bicycle can
        range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the
        world is the custom Madone by Damien Hirst, sold at US$500,000[8]),[9]
        depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can
        weigh as little as 3.2 kg (7 lb)[10]). However, UCI regulations stipulate
        a legal race bike cannot weigh less than 6.8 kg (14.99 lbs). Being
        measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before
        buying. The drivetrain components of the bike should also be considered. A
        middle grade d√©railleur is sufficient for a beginner, although many
        utility bikes are equipped with hub gears. If the rider plans a
        significant amount of hillclimbing, a triple-chainrings crankset gear
        system may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter, simpler, and
        less expensive double chainring is preferred, even on high-end race bikes.
        Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available. Many road bikes, along
        with mountain bikes, include clipless pedals to which special shoes
        attach, via a cleat, enabling the rider to pull on the pedals as well as
        push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear
        lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS,
        locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and
        pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages. For basic maintenance and
        repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a puncture repair
        kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers and a set of allen keys. Cycling
        can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and
        shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof
        clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and
        high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor
        vehicle users. Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or
        voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include bicycle helmets,[11]
        generator or battery operated lights, reflectors, and audible signalling
        devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include studded tires and a bicycle
        computer. Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat
        designs and handle bars, for example. Gears can also be customized to
        better suit the rider's strength in relation to the terrain.</p>
